# Scriptrure-Application
Scripture is an application that allows for high-quality translations of individual verses directly between 200 languages, including some of the world's lowest-resource languages with little to no biblical translations. The Scripture application allows the entire bible to be translated into these languages and made widely available, easily accessible, and free.

The Scripture application uses Meta AI's machine translation model, entitled "No Language Left Behind 200", or NLLB200 for short. As described by Meta, "[NLLB200] aims to allow people to access and share web content in their native language and communicate with anyone, regardless of their language preferences." The Scripture application seeks to leverage this state-of-the-art technology to take the Gospel to the world, as Jesus Christ commissioned the church to do throughout scripture.
